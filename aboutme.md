We study simulation techniques for fluid, structure, granular, and their interaction and develope computational mechanics methods 
sucsh as smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), finite element method (FEM), finite volume method (FVM), and discrete element method (DEM). Our research goal is to build bridges between industry and academia by utilizing computational analysis methodologies.

### SPH:
- Lagrangian based particle method
- Fluid mechanics and hydrodynamics
- Multiphase flow
- Fluid-structure interaction


### FEM:
- Lagrangian based grid method
- Structural engineering
- Mechanical/Aerospace/Automotive engineering


### FVM:
- Eulerian based grid method
- Fluid dynamics/Heat transfer/Transport phenomena
- Combustion/Reacting/Chemical engineering

### DEM:
- Lagrangian based particle method
- Geotechnical engineering
- Powder technology
- Material Science at the particle level
