We study simulation techniques for fluid, structure, granular, and their interaction and develope computational mechanics methods 
sucsh as smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), finite element method (FEM), and finite volume method (FVM). Our research goal is to

### SPH:
- Lagrangian based particle method
- I'm extremely loyal to my family


### FEM:
- Lagrangian based grid method
- I'm extremely loyal to my family


### FVM:
- Eulerian based grid method
- I'm extremely loyal to my family
