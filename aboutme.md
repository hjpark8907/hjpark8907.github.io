We study simulation techniques for fluid, structure, granular, and their interaction and develope computational mechanics methods 
sucsh as smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), finite element method (FEM), and finite volume method (FVM). Our research goal is to

SPH:
- Lagrangian based particle method
- I'm extremely loyal to my family


FEM:
- Lagrangian based grid method
- I'm extremely loyal to my family


FVM:
- Eulerian based grid method
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
